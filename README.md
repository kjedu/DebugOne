# DebugOne
This project will help you practice how to commit, push and pull on GitHub as well as testing your code to make sure everything is running smooth for your client.

# Getting Started
Looking at your SOW, you are to debug the Python file debug.py, make any necessary changes to get the code working, and submit the changes via a Pull Request with the following steps.
- Get added as a collaborator to your clients code.
- Create a branch or a fork so you have your own copy of the original code without messing up the actual original code.
- Make any changes to the code that will get it running.
- Commit according to your SOW, saving changes so you don't lose them.
- Push to the branch/fork, submitting your latest draft to your client
- Create a Pull Request to merge your branch into master, asking for a review and feedback on your code changes.

  # Prerequisites
  To get your code running or editing it you will need Githubcodespaces, Pycharm Community Edition or Visual Studio Code. Here are the links for all three:

- https://github.com/features/codespaces
- https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac
-  https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Running
Once you have one of the application in the prerequisties installed you can use the command
